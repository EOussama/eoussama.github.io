## Description
It's all about formality in this day and age, what's better than having a simple landing page to list all about you, your work, projects...etc.
This is my official portfolio for months or probably years to come, can we count a lifetime here as well?

So, how do they start these? long story short, I was born on the 27th of June, 1998, wow, one-fifth of a decade thus far, I'm as one may consider, the main character of my personal life, working hard to improve my skills as a developer, for all of the three major mediums, web, desktop, and mobile.
